No. We're not into that kinda stuff here.
Hi! Welcome to the repo! If you're here (which is an automatic yes, you're reading this) then that must be for one of two reasons:

a. You're here to try to break the game in as many ways as possible. If so, go right ahead! We love speedrunners. I myself, the person writing this message, am a speedrunner.

b. You're here to spoil the game for yourself / passively peruse the code for the game. In that case, don't, unless you wanna be a horrible person to yourself and make the game 10000000% more un-fun. Instead, do something more productive with your time, like actually _playing the game_!

If that b-part applies to you, then there IS a way to not spoil the game! Just don't look in the "script" folder, as that contains all of the dialogue for the entire game.

Happy bossrushing!
